       Welcome to the home of the  JDEE, an add-on software package that turns
       Emacs into a comprehensive system for creating, editing,
       debugging, and documenting Java applications. This site aims
       to provide you with complete information on downloading and
       installing the JDEE and obtaining technical support. The
       JDEE maintainers would like to thank <a href= 
      "http://sunsite.dk">SunSITE Denmark</a> for serving as the
       JDEE's host for many years. JDEE has now moved to
       <a target="_top" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdee/">
       sourceforge</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>
       About the JDEE
    </h2>
    <p>
       The JDEE is a software  package that interfaces Emacs to
      command-line Java development tools (for example, JavaSoft's
      JDK). JDEE features include:
    </p>

       If you have a problem with the JDEE, first check the <a href= 
      "trouble-shooting.htm">JDEE Troubleshooting Guide</a>. Next
      make sure that you have installed the latest version of the
      JDEE and the latest versions of the packages required by JDEE
      on your system. Also, make sure that that system path and the
      Emacs load-path variables list the paths to the required
      packages. Most problems reported by users are
      installation/setup problems.
    </p>
    <p>
       Installing Emacs packages can be tricky, especially for
      Emacs novices. If you are inexperienced, try finding a local
      Emacs guru to help you. You may also be able to get help
      installing supporting packages by sending messages to the <a
      href="#MailingList">JDEE mailing list</a> or
      posting messages to the Emacs help newsgroup
      (gnu.emacs.help).
    </p>
    <p>
      If after you have installed the required packages you still
      have a problem running the JDEE, please send your problem
      report (see <a href="rootpage.html#RequestingHelp">Requesting Help</a>)
      to the <a href="#MailingList">JDEE mailing list</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>
       <a name="RequestingHelp"></a>Requesting Help
    </h3>
    <p>
       When requesting help, it is important that you provide a
      complete, detailed description of the problem and the
      Emacs/JDEE environment in which it occurs. That way, you will
      avoid wasting precious time communicating potentially vital
      information needed to help you. Also, please do not make the
      mistake of assuming that you know what information is
      necessary to solve a problem. If you knew, you would not be
      asking for help, right? Nearly all the JDEE problems that I
      have seen are caused by faulty setups. Because Emacs is an
      open, extensible system, runs on many platforms, and allows
      unlimited customization, no two Emacs/JDEE setups are alike.
      Thus, when asking for help, it is particularly vital that you
      supply a complete description of your Emacs/JDEE environment,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
	<p>
        host platform (e.g., Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, etc.)
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
        JDEE version (e.g., JDEE 2.4.0.1)
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
        Emacs version (e.g., GNU Emacs 23.4.1)
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
        <i>complete</i> contents of your <code>.emacs</code> file. 
	</p>
        <p>
           <b>Note</b> Please do not make the common mistake of
          sending only the so-called "JDEE-related" part of an
          .emacs file. Settings in the omitted portion may conflict
          in subtle ways with the JDEE portion. Many Emacs users,
          especially novices, copy all or parts of their .emacs
          files from other sources without taking pains to
          understand the copied portions. When reporting a
          JDEE problem, the owner typically omits the borrowed
          sections as not "relevant" to the JDEE. Often, on the
          contrary, it is precisely the omitted portion that is the
          culprit.
        </p>
        <p>
           By the way, <code>.emacs</code> files are highly personal things. The
          easiest way for an Emacs newcomers to get into hot water
          is to borrow some grizzled veteran's overgrown, crufty
          .emacs file. An Emacs novice would do better to start
          with a blank slate, adding to it gradually and
          making sure to understand each addition completely, as it
          is added.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
	<p>
        Contents of the backtrace buffer if an error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>If the the Lisp variable <code>debug-on-error</code>
	is <code>t</code> when an error occurs,
	 Emacs opens a buffer listing the 
	sequence of Lisp function calls that led to the error.
	This is known as a backtrace. A backtrace often is
	enough to determine the cause of an error. You thus
	should <i>always</i> include it if it occurs.</p>

	<p> To get a backtrace, you
           must set the Lisp variable <code>debug-on-error</code>
	   to <code>t</code> <i>before</i>
	   the error occurs. The best way to do this is to put the
	   form  <code>(setq debug-on-error t)</code> in your 
	   <code>.emacs</code> file and restart Emacs. Alternatively
           you can use the <b>Options -> Enter Debugger on Error</b>
           menu item to enable it for the current Emacs session.
	</p>

      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
          Contents of the <code>*messages*</code> buffer <i>immediately
	  after</i> the error occurred.
	</p>

	<p><b>Note</b> The <code>*messages*</code> buffer is called
           the "message log" on XEmacs. To display the message log,
	   execute the command <code>show-message-log</code>.	
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>
        Contents of the <code>*JDEEbug*</code> buffer if you are having problems
        with JDEEbug
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
        Contents of the <code>prj.el</code> file for the project in which the
        problem occurred.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       If the problem occurs during startup, rerun Emacs, using the
      -debug-init command line switch. This causes Emacs to stop
      when an error occurs in your .emacs file and display the
      resulting backtrace in the backtrace buffer. Include the
      backtrace in your problem report.</p>
      <p>The JDEE includes a
       <b>JDE->Help->Submit Problem Report</b> command that creates a complete 
       snapshot of your system. If the error occurs after the JDEE is loaded,
       you can use this command to generate all the information you need
       to include in the problem report.
